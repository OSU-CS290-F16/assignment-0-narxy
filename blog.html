    <h4> Assignment 0 September 25th 2016</h4>
      <p>This assignment went fairly smoothly, the mdn html tutorial that was linked on the class website was very helpful.
         The biggest problem I had was that the picture for the index originally appeared upside down until I fliped it in paint. Otherwise everything was 
         pretty straightforward. </p>
